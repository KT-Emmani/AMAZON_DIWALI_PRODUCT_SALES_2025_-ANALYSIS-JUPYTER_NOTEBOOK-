RECOMMENDATION

Two main recommendations I would suggest are as follows;

* Amazon's largest customer base are Occassional Customers (50.08%), with One-Time & Regular customers having 38.49% and 11.43% respectively. In the coming year, they should focus on strategies to convert more customers from that occassional and One-time customers to Regular or VIP customers. This can be achieved by delving deeper into the history of customers in those category to understand their purchasing patterns to know their favorite Categories and Products and send them emails, ads and discount packages and also taking a second look at reviews to know and resolve major concerns raised by those customers especially the One-Time Customers. Resolving this by increasing the number of regular customers will lead to a lower recency rate and finally result in an above shift in the average total spending distribution.

* Amazon should also look into its delivery process because with over 65% of products ordered been either pending or returned is alarming. This could give a bad experience to new customers who will tend not doing any further purchases. They should take into factors the average delivery days, products with most returned orders (from the dataset you could see that the most product returned is Science Textbooks), reviews of customers and also flagged vendors with most returned products.
